# VirtualExhibitionManagerUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.

## Setup
For development, you will require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager. (Installing NodeJS should also install npm)
Once *npm* is available on your machine, you can install *Angular CLI* globally using the following command in your console:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Then, install the dependencies **in the vrem-ui folder** (you might need to `apt install build-essential` first) using
```bash
npm install
```

That's it. Now you should be ready to run VREM-ui!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
